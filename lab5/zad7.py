#Given is a chessboard A with dimensions n Ã— n. A chessboard
#contains rational numbers. It is necessary to move from field (1, 1) to field (n, n) using only "down" moves
#and "right". Entering a given field costs as much as the number there. Please enter some algorithm
#finding a route with the minimum cost.
