#A map of the country is given in the form of the graph G = (V, E), where the vertices are
#cities and edges are roads that connect cities. The length of each road is known (expressed in kilometers as a natural number). Alicja and Bob take (alternately) a bus from the city of x âˆˆ V to the city of y âˆˆ V,
#driving in each subsequent city. Alicja chooses the route and decides who is leading first.
#Please suggest an algorithm that indicates such a route (and the person who is to drive first) so that
#Alicja traveled as few kilometers as possible. The algorithm should be as fast as possible (but most of all
#correct).
